# Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the documentation for `@oxyzen-ui` library. Its a simple and Handpicked UI Components, Hooks and Utilities for React.

This library is a collection of React components, hooks and utilities that are easy to use. It was mainly created to be used in my personal projects, but I decided to share it with the community.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Note:** This library is still in development, so there may be some bugs.
  Also, the documentation is not fully complete yet. The CLI is also not ready
  yet. So, most of the stuffs has to be done manually. If you find any, please
  report them in the
  [issues](https://github.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/oxyzen-ui/issues) section.
