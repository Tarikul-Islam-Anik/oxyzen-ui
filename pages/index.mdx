# üëã Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the documentation for `@oxyzen-ui` library. Its a simple and Handpicked UI Components, Hooks and Utilities for [React](https://reactjs.org/) built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/introduction).

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  **Note:** This library is still in development, so there may be some bugs.
  Also, the documentation is not fully complete yet. The CLI is also not ready
  yet. So, most of the stuffs has to be done manually. If you find any, please
  report them in the
  [issues](https://github.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/oxyzen-ui/issues) section.

## üìñ Background Story

I was working on a project and I needed a simple UI library. I didn't want to use any of the existing UI libraries because they were too big and I didn't need most of the components. So, I decided to create my own library. I started with a few components and hooks, but then I realized that I was copy-pasting the same components and hooks in every project. So, I decided to create a library that I can use in all my projects.

I also wanted to make the components highly accessible and customizable. So, I decided to use the [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/introduction).

But there is no way to use the Radix Primitives with Tailwind CSS. So, I decided to create a library that will allow me to use the Radix Primitives with Tailwind CSS.

## üîç What's inside?

This library contains a collection of React components, hooks and utilities that are easy to use. It was mainly created to be used in my personal projects, but I decided to share it with the community.

I'm gonna make some of my own bits and pieces, like components, hooks, and tools. Plus, I'll snatch a few good ones from the open-source world and add 'em into the mix in this library.

I'll be tossing in some pro tips and smart moves I've picked up along the way.

## ‚ùóDon't be mistaken

This is not a UI framework or full component library. This is just a collection of components, hooks and utilities that I use in my projects. I created this library because I was tired of copy-pasting the same components and hooks in every project.
