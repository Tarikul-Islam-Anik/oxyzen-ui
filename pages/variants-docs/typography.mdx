  editing the `components/typography/variants.ts` file.

## Composing type

Use [Text](/Typography/text) and [Heading](/Typography/heading) components to render titles and body copy. These components share `size` and `weight` props and map to the underlying type system to ensure consistent typography throughout your app.

```jsx live=true
<Heading mb="2" size="xl">Typographic principles</Heading>
<Text>The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant.</Text>
```

### Formatting

Compose formatting components to add [emphasis](/Typography/em), [signal importance](/Typography/strong), present [code](/Typography/code) and more.

```jsx live=true
<Text>
  The <Em>most</Em> important thing to remember is,{" "}
  <Strong>stay positive</Strong>.
</Text>
```

## Type scale

The typographic system is based on a 9 step scale, every step has a corresponding `font-size`, `line-height` and `letter-spacing` value which are all designed to be used in combination.

| Size | Font Size | Line Height |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| xs   | 12px      | 16px        |
| sm   | 14px      | 20px        |
| base | 16px      | 24px        |
| lg   | 18px      | 28px        |
| xl   | 20px      | 32px        |
| 2xl  | 24px      | 36px        |
| 3xl  | 30px      | 40px        |
| 4xl  | 36px      | 48px        |
| 5xl  | 48px      | 56px        |
| 6xl  | 64px      | 72px        |
| 7xl  | 72px      | 80px        |
| 8xl  | 96px      | 104px       |
| 9xl  | 128px     | 136px       |
